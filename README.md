## 🔧 Ultra Lightweight Macro Program

A **minimalistic**, **high-performance** macro tool designed for power users who need flexibility without sacrificing system resources.

### ✨ Features

- 🚀 **Ultra Low Resource Usage** – Runs seamlessly on even the weakest systems.
- 📦 **Tiny File Size** – Tiny and efficient enough to replace your current macro/keybind software.
- 🎯 **Powerful Macro Engine** – Create robust macros using hotkeys or command triggers.
- ⌨️ **Keyboard Simulation** – Emulate any key press using [KeyCodes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes).
- 🖱️ **Mouse Simulation** – Simulate mouse clicks and movement.
- 📝 **Text Input Automation** – Type out full text blocks quickly.
- ⏱️ **Precise Delays** – Control timing down to the millisecond.
- 🔁 **Start-Loop-Finish System** – Build macros with start, loop, and finish actions that can loop when held or toggled.
- 🪟 **Windows Key Compatible** – Full support for the Windows key in bindings (Cannot override Windows exclusive keybinds i.e. Win+L).
- 🎮 **“Mod” Key System** – Acts like Logitech’s G-Shift for secondary hotkey layers.
  To use this, make a macro with Mod key down in the start list and Mod key up in the finish list. Then, when creating hotkeys that require it, prefix the activator with "Mod+". 
- 👤 **Profile Management** – Automatic profile switching based on the foreground window matching the profiles windows.
- 🧠 **Highly Performant** – Built to be good enough for gaming at a high level without input delay or resource hogging.
- 💸 **Completely Free** – No cost, but you can give me money anyway if you want :3.
