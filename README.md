# KPMacros

## 🔧 Ultra Lightweight Macro Program

A **minimalistic**, **high-performance** macro tool designed for everyone that needs flexibility without sacrificing system resources.
With a program size of <1MB, **`KPMacros`** comes fully equipt with a browser based UI that is simple for everyone to use!

### ✨ Features

- 🚀 **Ultra Low Resource Usage** – **`KPMacros`** uses <50MB of RAM when using 20 macros across 3 profiles, running seamlessly on even the weakest systems.
- 📦 **Tiny File Size** – Tiny and efficient enough to replace your current macro/keybind software.
- 🎯 **Powerful Macro Engine** – Create robust macros using hotkeys or command triggers.
- ⌨️ **Keyboard Simulation** – Emulate any key press using a list of [KeyCodes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes).
- 🖱️ **Mouse Simulation** – Simulate mouse clicks, movement, and scrolling.
- 📝 **Text Input Automation** – Type out full text blocks quickly.
- ⏱️ **Precise Delays** – Tired of inconsistently timed macros? **`KPMacros`** guarantees millisecond accurate delays!
- 🔊 **Soundboard** - Play audio files through a selected playback device with volume control.
- 🔁 **Start-Loop-Finish System** – Build macros with start, loop, and finish actions that can loop when held or toggled.
- 🪟 **Windows Key Compatible** – Full support for the Windows key in bindings (Cannot override Windows exclusive keybinds i.e. Win+L).
- 🎮 **“Mod” Key System** – Acts like Logitech’s G-Shift for a secondary hotkey layer.
  To use this, make a hotkey with the "Is Mod key" option checked. Then, when creating hotkeys, you can use it as a modifier. 
- 👤 **Profile Management** – Automatic profile switching based on the profiles assigned window.
- 🧠 **Highly Performant** – Built to be good enough for gaming at a high level without input delay or resource hogging, boasting a <1ms key down to macro activation time! 
- 💸 **Completely Free** – No cost, but you can give me money anyway if you want :3.
